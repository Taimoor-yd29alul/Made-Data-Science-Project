# Project Plan

## Title
The Americas.

## Main Question

How do enrollment and graduation rates vary across countries in The Americas, and what is their influence on labor market outcomes?

## Description

This project examines how enrollment and graduation rates vary across countries in The Americas and their impact on labor market outcomes. Using open data from sources like the OECD and IPUMS Higher Education, it analyzes education metrics such as graduation rates, employment, and wages. A data pipeline, built with tools like Jayvee and Python, will integrate and analyze these datasets to identify trends and disparities. The goal is to uncover how education influences labor market performance and inform policies aimed at reducing inequalities.
